**Paint App Clone**

**Overview**

This project is a basic Paint App clone that allows users to draw on a blank canvas using different brush sizes, colors, and an eraser tool. It was created using Python and the Tkinter library, which provides a simple graphical interface.
The app simulates the classic paint application that many users are familiar with, and it provides essential features like:
Drawing with different colors and brush sizes

Erasing parts of the drawing

Clearing the entire canvas

The app is beginner-friendly and serves as a simple introduction to graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and basic computer graphics programming in Python.


**Features**

Drawing Tool: Choose from a set of colors and draw freely on the canvas.

Brush Size: Adjust the size of your brush for finer or thicker lines.

Eraser Tool: Clear sections of your drawing with an adjustable eraser size.

Clear Button: Clear the entire canvas with one click.

Color Palette: Choose from a variety of colors for your drawing.



**Requirements**

Before running the app, ensure that you have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official Python website.
Additionally, this project uses the Tkinter library, which is included with most Python installations by default. If youâ€™re using a minimal installation of Python, you may need to install Tkinter separately. On Windows, Tkinter typically comes with Python.

**Installation**

Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.

Navigate to the project folder in your terminal or command prompt:
          cd path/to/your/project/folder
          
Run the application: Execute the Python script to start the paint application:
          python paint_app.py
          
This will open the paint app window where you can start drawing!


**Usage**

Drawing: Left-click and hold to draw on the canvas.

Color Selection: Click on any color in the palette to choose it as your drawing color.

Brush Size: Select a brush size from the options to adjust the thickness of your lines.

Eraser: Switch to the eraser tool to remove parts of your drawing.

Clear Canvas: Press the "Clear" button to erase all content on the canvas.
